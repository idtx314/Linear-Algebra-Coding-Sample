Hello! This is my code sample for the "Matrix Multiplication and Transposition" coding challenge. This zip directory includes a .git folder so that you can review my coding process if you wish.

My sample includes 3 files, which are located in the "Davis-Ian" directory:
    "Deployment Manual": A more detailed set of instructions in plaintext for compiling with the library and including it in code.
    "linalg.h": A header library containing the linear algebra functions and related objects required by the challenge.
    "main_example.cpp": A script that performs unit testing and demonstrates the functionality in the library.


"main_example.cpp" is intended to "demonstrate the correctness" of my solution by calling unit_tests() and performing some basic exercises.
When compiling main_example.cpp, keep it in the same directory as linalg.h and use the C++11 standard. Any compiler that complies with the standard should work. For detailed instructions reference the Deployment Manual included in the sample.
If using g++, you can navigate your command line interface to the directory containing the source files and enter the command:
    "g++ main_example.cpp -std=c++11"
